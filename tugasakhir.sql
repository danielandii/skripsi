(45, 'Kamera', 'nikon', 'D3100', 'gambar/3100.jpg', 2, 4600000, '<p>Garansi : Alta</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An entry level digital-SLR camera with a new CMOS image sensor, image-processing engine and helpful Guide mode that makes capturing beautiful images easy.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Equipped with a face detection function capable of detecting up to 35 human faces (D5000: up to 5 faces)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Operation has been improved with the addition of an independent movie-record button and release-mode selector.

The CMOS image sensor offers an effective pixel count of 14.2-million pixels (D3000: CCD image sensor with 10.2-million effective pixels) and enables capture of high-definition images exhibiting superior image quality with extremely detailed rendering and rich tones. The camera also makes the most of its standard sensitivity settings up to ISO 3200 (D3000: ISO 100&ndash;1600) and additional increases up to Hi 2 (ISO 12800 equivalent), with shooting under dim lighting, such as in the evening or indoors, as well as with sports scenes of rapidly moving subjects. <br /><br /> EXPEED 2 is Nikon\'s new image-processing engine, developed by refining the concepts, know-how and technologies regarding digital images that Nikon has spent years cultivating. It maximises the performance of the CMOS image sensor to suppress noise in still images and movies and produces images that faithfully reproduce vivid colors.</blockquote>\r\n<p><br /> <br /> <strong>2) A refined Guide mode that is even easier to use</strong>Guide mode has been refined to make most camera operations even easier, from shooting to image playback and editing to the application of camera settings, regardless of the user\'s skill level. <br /><br /> <strong>Assist images</strong> <br /><br /> The D3100 displays \"assist images\" that show the effect of various camera settings, giving users an idea of the results they can expect with specified settings. For example, when \"Soften backgrounds\" is selected and an aperture value is specified, the assist image displayed in the monitor changes to show the effect that aperture setting will have on images. This allows users to confirm that images will appear as they intended prior to shooting and reduces the number of unsuccessful shots.<br /><br /> <strong>Other new functions built into Guide mode:</strong><br /><br /></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Selection from 3 shooting techniques: \"Use the viewfinder,\" \"Use live view,\" \"Shoot movies\"</li>\r\n<li>\"Bring more into focus\" and \"Show water flowing\" options have been added to the \"Advanced operation\" menu for shooting</li>\r\n<li>\"Movie settings,\" \"HDMI,\" \"Flicker reduction\" and \"Eye-Fi upload\"* options have been added to the \"Set Up\" menu for applying basic camera settings</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><br /><strong><em>* </em></strong><em>Only available when compatible Eye-Fi memory card is inserted</em></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /> <br /> <strong>3) Live view mode that allows users to use the camera monitor to easily frame still image or movies<br /><br /> </strong>By simply rotating the live view switch, the view through the lens is displayed in the monitor, enabling immediate live view recording. This makes shooting feel more like shooting with a compact digital camera, easing the transition to digital-SLR for beginners. In addition, various information such as the shooting mode, time remaining (movie mode) and battery indicator, can be shown in the live view display. <strong><br /><br /> 4) D-Movie for recording and editing full-HD movies and AF-F (full-time servo AF) focus mode for movie recording<br /> <br /> <br /> </strong>The D3100 is equipped with the D-Movie function that enables recording of high-definition movies (with monaural sound) by simply pressing the movie-record button. Movies can be recorded with the same aperture and other settings applied in Guide mode, and movies that take full advantage of the characteristics of individual interchangeable lenses, whether wide-angle, telephoto or fisheye, can be recorded for movies that are only possible with a digital-SLR camera. In addition, the camera also offers an AF-F (full-time servo AF) focus mode for movie recording. When AF-F mode is enabled, the camera focuses continuously during movie recording without the need for holding the shutter-release button down halfway. The D3100 also offers in-camera movie editing functions that allow users to save a single frame as a still image or delete unnecessary portions from the beginning or end of movie files. <br /><br /> <strong>5) Scene auto selector built in</strong> <br /><br /> <br /> The D3100 is equipped with the scene auto selector function. When live view mode is enabled in Auto or Auto (flash off) mode, the camera automatically analyses the scene and selects the appropriate shooting mode from Portrait, Landscape, Close up or Night portrait*. This function allows users achieve the intended images while leaving all settings up to the camera. <br /><br /> <em>* Scene auto selector is disabled with manual focusing.</em></p>'),

These features enable capture of high-resolution images with excellent expression of tones. With standard sensitivity settings of ISO 100 - 6400 and additional increases up to Hi 2 (ISO 25600 equivalent), the camera offers improved capability with shooting under dim lighting, such as in the evening or indoors, and also produces better results with capture of rapidly moving subjects. <br /><br /> The High Dynamic Range (HDR) function captures two shots of varying exposure each time the shutter-release button is pressed, and then combines the two shots into a single image with a broad dynamic range. Resulting images beautifully recreate the scene as seen with the naked eye, even with shooting of backlit scenes, with little or no loss of detail in shadows or highlights.<br /><br /> <img src=\"http://ato-new.nikon-asia.com/pages/ato/articles/252/hdr-sample.jpg\" alt=\"HDR Sample Image \" width=\"499\" height=\"333\" /> HDR Sample Image<br /><br /> <strong>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3-in., approximately 921k-dot vari-angle monitor with wide viewing angle and increased visibility</strong><br /><br /> Visibility has been increased with the large 3-inch, approximately 921k-dot high-resolution vari-angle monitor adopted for the D5100. In addition, the range of colors that can be reproduced by the monitor is equivalent to that of the sRGB gamut.<br /><br /> Adoption of a side hinge for the vari-angle monitor prevents the monitor from hitting the tripod when it is opened while the camera is mounted on a tripod. The vari-angle monitor opens from 0 to 180&deg; to the side, and can be rotated up to 90&deg; clockwise and up to 180&deg; counter-clockwise when it is open. This enables shooting from a wide variety of angles, from low to high, making even self portraits possible. <br /><img src=\"http://ato-new.nikon-asia.com/pages/ato/articles/252/D5100_LCD_6_s.jpg\" alt=\"Vari-angle monitor movement diagram\" width=\"328\" height=\"245\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\" />Vari-angle monitor movement diagram<br /><br /> <strong>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D-Movie for recording and editing of Full-HD movies</strong><br /><br /> The D5100 is equipped with the D-Movie function that enables recording of high-definition movies (1920 x&nbsp;1080p, 30p) exhibiting superior video quality. Autofocusing during movie recording is possible using contrast-detect AF. When the focus mode is set to full-time-servo AF (AF-F) and the AF-area mode to subject-tracking AF, the camera automatically maintains focus on a subject moving throughout the frame. The D5100 also offers in-camera movie editing functions that allow users to save a single frame as a still JPEG image or delete unnecessary portions from the beginning and/or end of movie files. What\'s more, the D5100 is equipped with built-in support for stereo audio recording via the Stereo Microphone ME-1 (available separately), and the mode dial and live view switch have been positioned on the same spindle in consideration of operational ease. <br /><br /> <img src=\"http://ato-new.nikon-asia.com/pages/ato/articles/252/mode-dial.jpg\" alt=\"Mode dial, live view switch image(s)\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" hspace=\"5\" /> Mode dial, live view switch image(s)<br /><br /> <img src=\"http://ato-new.nikon-asia.com/pages/ato/articles/252/stereo-mic-me1.jpg\" alt=\"Stereo mic ME-1 image\" width=\"300\" height=\"253\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\" /><br /><br /> The optional Stereo Microphone ME-1 can be used to record sound in stereo while also preventing noise caused by lens vibration being recorded during autofocus.<br /><br /> <strong>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first Nikon digital-SLR camera to offer Special Effects mode</strong><br /><br /> The D5100 offers special effects that can be selected and applied with both shooting of still images and recording of movies. Special effects are displayed with the view through the lens in the monitor before shooting or recording begins, allowing users to confirm the desired results in real time. Users can easily enjoy adding special effects to movies. This mode was adopted to respond to the creative intent of users searching for a way to express their own unique style and creativity.</p>'),

Targeted at advanced digital photographers, both lenses are designed to work exclusively with Canon EOS 20D and EOS 300D digital SLR cameras. The focal length ranges of the respective lenses translates to 27-136mm and 16-35mm respectively in 35mm film format &ldquo; a spread carefully chosen by Canon to reflect the needs of its rapidly growing base of advanced D-SLR photographers. Both lenses feature Canon ring-type Ultra Sonic Motors (USM) for fast, near-silent auto focus, and a range of features designed to deliver a level of image quality approaching that of Canon revered L-Series professional lenses.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Standard</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"> Ideal for travel, mid-range nature/wildlife and general photography, the EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM is a high quality, lightweight, all-purpose standard zoom lens. This 5x zoom lens offers the widest range of any lens in this class, and features Canon latest optical Image Stabilizer technology, providing up to 3-stop compensation for image blur caused by camera shake and slow shutter speeds. With superb quality suited to semi-professional use, the lens has a 17 element, 12 group construction, including one double-sided aspherical element for crisp, high contrast corner-to-corner detail. </span> </span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Wide Angle</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM is the market lightest and smallest 16-35mm (35mm equivalent) zoom lens available; ideal for landscape or indoor photography, or for photographers wishing to experiment with pan-focus and dramatic perspective effects. It also boasts a remarkably close focusing distance of just 24 cm. With similar high build quality to the EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM, the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM includes a Super UD (ultra-dispersion) glass lens and two aspherical elements in its 13 element, 10 group construction.

The APS-C sized sensor of these cameras results in an effective multiplication factor of 1.6x the indicated focal length. While this creates an obvious advantage for telephoto lenses, it is less beneficial when meeting wide-angle requirements. To meet the needs of the new digital photographers, Canon developed the wide-angle EF-S lens mount. The EOS 20D and EOS 300D are both completely compatible with all existing EF lenses, while EF-S lenses only fit these two cameras. Optimized for Digital SLRs with APS-C size sensors, the EF-S mount enables economic wide-angle solutions often required by advanced photographers. The \"S\" in the EF-S nomenclature stands for the term short back focus. This describes the system that allows the rear lens element of EF-S lenses to be positioned closer than normal to the image sensor of APS-C sensor cameras. A white lens mount index differentiates the lenses from other EF lenses, which retain their traditional red marking. A rear rubber ring prevents any damage in the event that an inadvertent attempt is made to mount the lenses on non-compatible cameras.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Fast auto-focus</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The ring-type USM motors found in both lenses employ ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive focussing with unrivalled speed. Canon ring-type USM holds the lens with precision and accuracy, the instant it arrives at the correct focus point and without overshoot. To further improve accuracy and speed, the drive patterns of both lenses are tailored to specifically match that of the EOS 20D and EOS 300D. Both lenses also feature full-time manual focus override without risk of motor damage.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Appealing background blur</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The lenses both incorporate an EMD (electromagnetic diaphragm), which employs an almost perfectly circular barrel aperture.

Since EF-S lenses only mount on Canon EF-S bodies - which all feature a 1.6x FOVCF - the 17-55mm focal length range always equates to the field of view of a 27.2-88mm lens mounted on a full-frame Digital SLR. This range covers what I consider to be the most important focal lengths for a Canon general purpose lens. This is a focal length range that can be used for everything from a wide scenic landscape to a relatively-close portrait. Interesting is that Canon already had these focal lengths similarly covered in their econo kit lens - the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens. Reality is that these are vastly different lenses - in build, optical and feature qualities - and price. The kit lens is a good value for the money, but does not compare with the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens. Canon already had a superset of the 17-55mm focal length range covered with the Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens. This lens has a higher build quality, image quality and feature set than the EF-S 18-55 - adding Ring USM and 3 stop image stabilization to the feature set. What the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens adds to the 17-85\'s feature set is a fixed f/2.8 aperture and L-Series grade UD (Ultra-Low Dispersion glass) lens elements. Of course, price, size, weight and a reduced focal length range are the downsides of the 17-55 compared to the 17-85. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Review\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">With a fixed fast f/2.8 aperture (meaning the widest aperture opening is f/2.8 through the entire focal length range - f/22 is the narrowest setting), exposure settings do not change when zooming in on a subject. To some, this is not a big deal - to me, this is a great feature. F/2.8 is as fast as any Canon zoom lens currently made. It is fast enough to stop action in many indoor venues (higher ISO settings typically required - fast action indoor sports may require f/2 or wider). This wide aperture also activates the higher autofocus sensitivity mode for certain focus points in many Canon bodies (f/2.8 does not have to be selected to get the benefit of this feature). F/2.8 also presents a bright viewfinder to the user. Combining an f/2.8 aperture with the 3 stop image stabilization, the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens is arguably the most handholdable lens Canon currently makes. Image stabilization will allow a shot to be taken at a shutter speed up to 3 stops slower than without IS. Sorry, but it will not stop subject motion. This IS version is tripod sensing to prevent feedback loops between the IS sensor and stabilizer motor vibrations. The manual recommends turning IS off when tripod-mounting the lens (to save battery life) or when panning (panning mode IS is not available). Leave IS on when handholding or shooting from a monopod. The IS implementation on this lens is very well behaved - it is quiet and does not cause the image to jump when starting up. <br /> <br /> With Ring USM (Ultrasonic Motor), the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens focuses very quietly and very fast. Focus accuracy has been very good for me (an equally or even more important fact). FTM (Full Time Manual) focusing is a very nice feature of this lens. The focus ring is rather small, but turns easily. Likely to get far more use is the zoom ring - it is very nicely sized and turns smoothly with little effort. The AF and IS switches are recessed to prevent accidental changes. Canon claims that \"By optimising Super Spectra lens coatings and lens element shaping, Canon&rsquo;s engineers have been effective in suppressing flare and ghosting &shy; more prone to occur with digital cameras due to reflection off the image sensor. By increasing light absorption, coatings reduce reflections off lens element surfaces to deliver crisp, undistorted images with natural colour balance.\" In reality, I am finding the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens to be somewhat flare-prone if the sun or bright light is in the frame. Otherwise, contrast is very nice. Pictured above installed from left to right with hoods in place are the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC Lens, Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II Lens and Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens. The same lenses are pictured fully extended below. Prior to receiving my Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens, I stated that I expected its image quality to match or nearly match that of Canon\'s L Series Lenses as it shares the L-Series UD lens elements. As it turns out, my 17-55 matches or exceeds the optical performance of my L-Series zooms in this similar focal length range ... <br /> <br /> This lens is sharp! Wide open and from edge to edge. Unless the distance is close that is - I\'m finding that close subjects do not produce the same image sharpness as normal distance subjects. The ISO 12233 chart test results indicate this as well. The Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens shows slight sharpness improvement at f/4, but performance at f/2.8 is very good. Though I have not compared it directly to the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens, the 17-55 compares favorably with any other current Canon EF or EF-S zoom lens in this focal length range. My Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8 L USM Lens is slightly sharper in the center at 17mm wide open, but the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens is sharper at all other tested focal lengths - and proved much sharper in the corners at all focal lengths and apertures. Distortion was also less on the 17-55. In my opinion, the only reasons to buy the 16-35 over the 17-55 are for full-frame compatibility (a big reason), better build quality and environmental sealing (EF-S compatible bodies are not weather sealed at this time). Similar story with the Canon EF 17-40mm f/4 L USM Lens. The Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens is sharper at all other tested focal lengths - and proved much sharper in the corners at all focal lengths and apertures. At close distances, the 17-40 had sharper corners and held its sharpness to a narrower focal length than the 17-55. Lower barrel distortion at the wide end is also in the 17-55\'s favor. Full-frame compatibility (a big reason), better build quality and environmental sealing are in the 17-40 L\'s favor. I suspect the wider price discrepancy between these two lenses will keep sales of the 17-40 L going stronger than for the 16-35. Distortion is present over most of the focal length range. Mild barrel distortion is present until about 24mm where pincushion distortion becomes present through 55mm. Your spouse will appreciate how the 17-55 makes them look thinner at the longer focal lengths (use this excuse if you need help getting spousal purchase permission). Being a wide aperture, wide angle lens, expect to see some vignetting from the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens. The amount of vignetting is less than I anticipated - basically visible only in the corners at f/2.8 when photographing an even-colored subject such as a blue sky. One of the benefits of using an EF lens on an EF-S body is that much of the lens vignetting is not apparent within the cropped field of view. </span></p>'),

It also boasts a remarkably close focusing distance of just 24 cm. With similar high build quality to the EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM, the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM includes a Super UD (ultra-dispersion) glass lens and two aspherical elements in its 13 element, 10 group construction. The non-rotating front element makes it ideal for use with filters such as polarizing and graduated, both of which are popular for the type of landscape photography for which the lens is suited.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Fast auto-focus</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The ring-type USM motors found in both lenses employ ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive focussing with unrivalled speed. Canon ring-type USM holds the lens with precision and accuracy, the instant it arrives at the correct focus point and without overshoot. To further improve accuracy and speed, the drive patterns of both lenses are tailored to specifically match that of the EOS 20D and EOS 300D. Both lenses also feature full-time manual focus override without risk of motor damage. This 5x zoom lens offers the widest range of any lens in this class, and features Canon latest optical Image Stabilizer technology, providing up to 3-stop compensation for image blur caused by camera shake and slow shutter speeds. With superb quality suited to semi-professional use, the lens has a 17 element, 12 group construction, including one double-sided aspherical element for crisp, high contrast corner-to-corner detail. </span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Appealing background blur</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The lenses both incorporate an EMD (electromagnetic diaphragm), which employs an almost perfectly circular barrel aperture. This helps create an attractive, even background blur when the photographer minimises depth of field to isolate a subject. This describes the system that allows the rear lens element of EF-S lenses to be positioned closer than normal to the image sensor of APS-C sensor cameras. A white lens mount index differentiates the lenses from other EF lenses, which retain their traditional red marking. A rear rubber ring prevents any damage in the event that an inadvertent attempt is made to mount the lenses on non-compatible cameras.</span></span></p>'),

Its announcement is unlikely to come as a surprise to many, as rumours of its imminent introduction have been circulating on the web for weeks, but it will still please Canon owners in search of an all-in-one lens ideally suited to travel and everyday shooting. With its 11x zoom range, this lens is Canon\'s most ambitious consumer-level zoom to date; the company has previously shied away from producing relatively inexpensive superzooms, with its only previous foray into this sector being the 28-200mm F3.5-5.6 (USM) for 35mm, which was introduced in late 2000. Indeed it\'s this older lens which the 18-200mm most strongly resembles, however Canon have managed to squeeze plenty more into the design in the intervening eight years. The zoom range has been stretched to a 35mm-equivalent range of 29-320mm, and the new lens incorporates Canon\'s latest compact image stabilization unit (as seen on the EF-S 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 IS and the EF-S 55-250mm F4.5-5.6 IS), which offers automatic panning detection and (according to the company) four stops of stabilization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">One design decision may however cause a degree of dismay; the lens uses a relatively unsophisticated micro motor system for autofocus, as opposed to the ring-type USM design more commonly seen on mid-range lenses such as the EF-S 17-85mm F3.5-5.6 IS USM. Consequently, potential buyers may struggle to find any obvious advantage over Tamron\'s recently announced 18-270mm F3.5-6.3Di II VC LD Aspherical (IF) Macro, which sports a longer zoom range and Tamron\'s own optical stabilization system. Aside from this, Canon have produced a lens which is clearly designed to counter the undeniable buyer appeal of Nikon\'s popular AF-S 18-200mm F3.5-5.6 VR head-on.

IS reduces dramatically the image blur caused by camera shake. Gyro sensors detect unwanted vibrations, triggering the corresponding movement of a correcting lens group perpendicular to the optical axis. This alters the light path, returning the image to its correct position on the sensor or film plane. For shooting immobile subjects, Mode 1 corrects for movement in the image along both the horizontal and vertical axes. For shooting while panning horizontally to follow a moving subject, Mode 2 turns off vertical correction and prevents the effect of dragging the subject back through the frame. IS switches off automatically when the camera is mounted on a tripod, thus preventing feedback loops between the IS sensor and internal motor vibrations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong> Superb auto-focus</strong></p>\r\n<p>The lens Ring-type USM employs ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive auto focus with unrivalled speed and near-silent operation.

Photographers can switch to manual focus instantly and at any time simply by moving the manual focus ring without first having to switch out of auto focus mode.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong> f/4 from 70 to 200mm</strong></p>\r\n<p>The EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM offers the highest possible optical quality with no change in aperture over the full focal range of the lens. This allows photographers to set exposure at the widest aperture and zoom all the way through to 200mm without having to decrease shutter speed. Lens length does not alter during zooming and the front lens element does not rotate during zooming or focusing. The lens employs an almost perfectly circular barrel aperture, helping create attractive, even background blur.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong> Image quality</strong></p>\r\n<p>A newly designed optical system limits lens size and improves image clarity over the total image area. 1 x Fluorite element and 2 x Ultra-Low Dispersion glass elements are used to eliminate the secondary chromatic aberrations that otherwise reduce sharpness and introduce colour fringing. By optimising Super Spectra lens coatings and lens element shaping, Canon engineers have been effective in suppressing flare and ghosting &ldquo; more prone to occur with digital cameras due to reflection off the image sensor.

When used in conjunction with Canon range of EX Speedlite flash units, the lens passes distance information to the flash algorithm for markedly improved flash exposure metering. To match the weather resistance afforded by EOS-1 pro camera bodies, an O-ring seals the lens against the lens mount to prevent the ingress of dust and moisture.</p>'),

Featuring the latest 3-stop Image Stabilizer for outstanding camera shake reduction, the lens also features super responsive auto focus. Replacing the popular EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM, the world first interchangeable lens with Image Stabilizer (IS), the lens is expected to appeal to serious amateur nature and sports photographers looking to achieve outstanding results while shooting hand held. </span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Image Stabilizer</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">IS dramatically reduces image blur caused by camera shake. The EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM features Canon latest 3-stop IS, a one-stop improvement over its predecessor. This allows shutter speeds up to three stops slower than would otherwise be possible, with no perceptible increase in image blur. Photographers normally shooting a 300mm frame handheld at 1/500s can obtain the equivalent result with a shutter speed of just 1/60s, vastly extending options in low light conditions. Gyro sensors detect unwanted vibrations, triggering the corresponding movement of a correcting lens group perpendicular to the optical axis. This alters the light path, returning the image to its correct position on the sensor or film plane. The EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM provides 2-mode IS for shooting immobile subjects. Mode 1 stabilizes the image along both the horizontal and vertical axes. For shooting while panning to follow a moving subject, Mode 2 turns off correction in the panned direction and prevents the effect of dragging the subject back through the frame. IS switches off automatically when the camera is mounted on a tripod, thus preventing feedback loops between the IS sensor and stabilizer motor vibrations.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Superb auto-focus</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The micro USM motor found in the EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM employs ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive auto focus with unrivalled speed and near-silent operation. Good holding torque stops the lens with precision and accuracy, the instant it arrives at the correct focus point and without overshoot. A high speed CPU and optimised AF algorithm result in a significant increase of AF speed compared to that of its predecessor. A zoom ring locking mechanism is provided that locks the zoom at the wide-angle setting. This ensures that the lens is carried or stored in its most compact position, preventing possible damage caused by the lens extending and hitting obstacles when being carried mounted on a camera with a strap.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Pleasing defocused background</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">The EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM employs an electro magnetic diaphragm (EMD) with a circular aperture.

(84, 'Lensa', 'Canon', 'EFS 60mm F/2.8 Macro USM', 'gambar/img4722f9b405b11.jpg', 1, 4300000, '<p>Garansi : Datascrip</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">Canon, a leader in photographic and imaging technology, today announces the EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro USM lens. Targeted at advanced and creative D-SLR photographers, the lens fits exclusively to those digital EOS cameras with an APS-C size sensor and an EF-S lens mount - the EOS 20D, EOS 300D and the new EOS 350D Digital. Featuring a true 1:1 macro magnification ratio, the lens has a focal length equivalent of 96mm in the 35mm format. This very closely matches the EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM, Canon most popular single focal length lens. The lens features Canon ring-type Ultra Sonic Motor (USM) for fast, near-silent auto focus, a new AF algorithm for improved focusing speed, a close focusing distance of just 0.2m and a range of optical features designed to deliver high levels of image quality.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>EF-S mount</strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">The APS-C sized sensor of the EF-S mount cameras to which the lens is matched gives these cameras an effective multiplication factor of 1.6x the indicated focal length &ldquo; creating an obvious advantage for macro photography. The \"S\" in the EF S nomenclature stands for the term short back focus. This describes the system that allows for a smaller image circle and positioning of the rear lens element closer than normal to the camera mage sensor. A white lens mount index differentiates the lens from other EF lenses, which retain their traditional red marking. A rear rubber ring prevents any damage in the event that an accidental attempt is made to mount the lens on incompatible cameras.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Precision lens</strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">The lens has a 12 element, 8 group construction, and a three group inner focus system that delivers crisp, high contrast corner-to-corner detail. An internal 3 group focusing system allows the lens length to remain fixed when the focus ring is turned. This makes it ideal for set ups where the lens is very close to foreground subject matter, and for use with Canon lens mounted macro flash systems; the MT-24EX and MR-14EX twin and ring flash units.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Fast auto-focus</strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">The lens ring-type USM motor employs ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive focussing with unrivalled speed. Canon ring-type USM holds the lens with precision and accuracy, the instant it arrives at the correct focus and without overshoot. The lens drive algorithm has been enhanced to further improve focus accuracy and speed. The lens also features full-time manual focus override without risk of motor damage.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Appealing background blur</strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">An EMD (electromagnetic diaphragm) barrel aperture helps to create attractive, even background blur when the photographer minimises depth of field to isolate a subject. This combines with the 60mm focal length to suit the lens perfectly to portrait photography. </span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Perfect for digital photography</strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">By optimising Super Spectra lens coatings, Canon engineers have been effective in suppressing flare and ghosting, which are more prone to occur with digital cameras due to the relatively reflective nature of image sensors. By absorbing light, coatings reduce reflections off lens surfaces to deliver crisp, undistorted digital images with natural colour balance.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\"><strong>Distant linked flash</strong></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana;\">The lens passes distance information to the camera body, to provide compatibility with the E-TTL II flash system of the EOS 20D and EOS 350D Digital. When used in conjunction with Canon range of EX Speedlite flash units, this allows for markedly improved flash exposure metering. An optional lens hood accessory is available. The EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro USM can be used with the Canon extension tubes EF 12 II and EF 25 II for even closer focusing and larger than life images. In harmony with the environment, In keeping with Canon stringent environmental policy, only lead free glass is used in the lens optics.</span></p>'),

The lens has a 95mm filter thread and is also supplied with a step down ring enabling digital cameras with an APS-C size image sensor to use an 86mm diameter filter.<br /> *It is not possible to use a Polarising filter with the step down ring. If you attach a Polarising filter, you may not be able to remove it again from the lens.</span></p>'),
